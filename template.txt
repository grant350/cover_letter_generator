Let me share some unique things about myself. I started programming when I was 16 years old, and the first book I picked up was javascript. I have always been curious about how to make websites, and how computers work. This passion I have always makes me humble to learn new things everyday. From years ago to now,  I am proficient in fullstack and some devops which is a great demanded skill in developer positions.
